# hardhat-gas-reporter

**Gas Usage Analysis for Hardhat**

- Profile gas costs with your test suite.
- Get metrics for method calls and deployments on L1 and L2.
- Get national currency costs of deploying and using your contract system

### Example report

## Installation

Add the following to your hardhat.config.ts:
```ts
import "hardhat-gas-reporter"
```

## Configuration
Configuration is optional.
```js
// hardhat.config.ts
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  gasReporter: {
    currency: 'EUR',
    L1: "polygon",
    coinmarketcap: "abc123...",
    etherscan: "ABC123...",
  }
}
```

## Usage

This plugin overrides the built-in `test` task. Gas reports are generated by default with:
```
npx hardhat test
```

**:bulb:  Turning the plugin on/off**

The options include an `enabled` key that lets you toggle gas reporting on and off using shell
environment variables. When `enabled` is false, test execution can be a bit faster because fewer
calls are made to the client to read gas data.
Example:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  gasReporter: {
    enabled: (process.env.REPORT_GAS) ? true : false
  }
}
```

*NB*: If you're using a hardhat template project and not seeing a gas report, look at your `hardhat.config.ts` and see how the authors' have configured the reporter - many of them use an ENV variable toggle by default.

**:bulb: Caveats about Accuracy**:
+ The hardhat client implements the Ethereum Foundation EVM. To get accurate measurements for other EVM-based chains you may need to run your tests against development clients developed specifically for those networks.
+ Gas usage readings for `pure` and `view` method calls are **only a lower bound** of their real world cost (which will be 100's to 1000's of gas higher). Actual gas usage depends on the way the methods are called and the storage/memory state of the EVM at the moment of invocation. For more information on this see the great summary at [wolfio/evm/gas][1]
+ L2 calldata gas usage readings for Optimism (e.g. `L1GasUsed`) are approximations - typically within 1% of observed usage on optimistic-scan. A small amount of variance is expected.

### Options

+ Common config setups for various use cases can be seen in the [Example Configs docs][2].
+ Get a [free tier Coinmarketcap API key][3]
+ Get a [free tier Etherscan API key][4] (NB: these are network specific)

These APIs have [rate limits](https://docs.etherscan.io/support/rate-limits). Depending on the usage, it might require an [API Key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics).

> NB: Any gas price API call which returns a JSON-RPC response formatted like this is supported: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":73,"result":"0x6fc23ac00"}`.


## Parallelization

This plugin also adds a Hardhat Task for merging several `gasReporterOutput.json` files, which are generated by [eth-gas-reporter](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter) when [running your tests with in parallelized jobs in CI](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter/blob/master/docs/gasReporterOutput.md).

To use the task you just have to give it the filepaths or a glob pattern pointing to all of the reports:
```bash
npx hardhat gas-reporter:merge 'gasReporterOutput-*.json'
```
