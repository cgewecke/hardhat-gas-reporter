# hardhat-gas-reporter

**Gas Usage Analytics for Hardhat**

- Get gas metrics for method calls and deployments on L1 and L2 by running your test suite.
- Get national currency costs of deploying and using your contract system.
- Output data in multiple formats including text, markdown, reStructuredText and JSON.

### Example report

![Screen Shot 2024-04-02 at 6 04 53 PM](https://github.com/cgewecke/hardhat-gas-reporter/assets/7332026/9f1eadb0-f47b-45fe-bfdb-57d4d2f07042)

+ See [markdown format example][10]

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat-gas-reporter
```

Add the following to your hardhat.config.ts:
```ts
import "hardhat-gas-reporter"
```

## Configuration
Configuration is optional.
```js
// Example
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  gasReporter: {
    currency: 'EUR',
    L1: "polygon",
    coinmarketcap: "abc123...",
  }
}
```

## Usage

This plugin overrides the built-in `test` task. Gas reports are generated by default with:
```
npx hardhat test
```

**:bulb:  Turning the plugin on/off**

The `enabled` option lets you toggle gas reporting on and off using shell environment variables.
Tests run faster when the gas reporter is off because fewer calls are made to the client to read data.

```ts
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  gasReporter: {
    enabled: (process.env.REPORT_GAS) ? true : false
  }
}
```

**:mag: Caveats about Accuracy**:
+ Gas readings for `pure` and `view` methods are **only a lower bound** of their real world cost. Actual gas usage will depend on the way the methods are called and the storage/memory state of the EVM at the moment of invocation. For more information on this see the excellent summary at [wolfio/evm/gas][1]
+ L1 gas readings for Arbitrum & OPStack chains are approximations - some variance is expected.
  + Optimism estimates should be within 1% of observed usage on [optimistic-etherscan][100].
  + Arbitrum estimates should be within 10% of observed usage on [arbiscan][111]
+ The Hardhat client implements the Ethereum Foundation EVM. To get accurate measurements for other EVM-based chains you may need to run your tests against development clients developed specifically for those networks.

## Utility Tasks

The plugin also provides additional utility commands for managing gas reporter output

### hhgas:merge

Merges several JSON formatted gas reports into a single object. This is useful if you're post-processing the data and running your tests in a parallelized CI environment.

**Usage**
```bash
npx hardhat hhgas:merge "gasReporterOutput-*.json"
```

## Supported Networks

API keys for the networks this plugin auto-configures via the `L1` and `L2` options are available from the links below. In many cases these aren't equired - you'll only need to set them if you start seeing rate-limit warnings.

**L2**

+ [arbitrum][113] (live `baseFeePerByte` prices require an API key)
+ [base][110] (live `blobBaseFee` prices require an API key)
+ [optimism][109] (live `blobBaseFee` prices require an API key)

**L1**

+ [ethereum][101]
+ [polygon][102]
+ [binance][103]
+ [fantom][104]
+ [moonbeam][105]
+ [moonriver][106]
+ [gnosis][107]
+ [avalanche][108]

## Funding

You can support hardhat-gas-reporter via [DRIPS][11], a public goods protocol that helps you direct funding to packages in your dependency tree.
